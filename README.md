<!-- I went through the HTML and changed all the <div> tags to semantic tags to make the code read easier
     then I went through the .CSS file and refracted it to reduce redundancies and make that easier to read -->

<!-- i also changed the title of the site in HTML for SEO -->

<!-- i then added ChromeVox screen reader to make sure it was able to read the site and was more accesible -->
